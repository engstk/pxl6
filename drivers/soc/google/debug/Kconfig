	help
	  Debug snapshot supports SoC debugging easily. This feature supports
	  to trace other module events such frequceny change and IPC.
	  This supports to save GPR and PC when panic or exception and
	  to enter ramdump mode when panic is occurred and other exception.
	  This supports to reserve memory for h/w debug feature such as
	  scan2dram, arraydump.

	  There are some kernel events in only core-kernel.
	  If we get the events, we should need built-in driver.
	  This supports to get kernel events of core-kernel such as
	  interrupts, task switching, workqueue and cpuidle.

config DEBUG_SNAPSHOT_SFRDUMP

	depends on DEBUG_SNAPSHOT
	default n
	help
	  This supports sfrdump to string format into the DRAM
	  if kernel panic happened. If you want to get dump,
	  you should write list of sfr registers in device tree.
	  If you want to dump sfr register, you say Y here.

config DEBUG_SNAPSHOT_QUICKDUMP

	help
	  This is for weight ligntening of ramdump. If DRAM size is too big,
	  Ramdump is also big. Then it takes a long time to get ramdump.
	  So we get important data such as dss logging and H/W raw data.
	  If you access text symbol and stack data, you could get them.
	  But in GKI, we can't access section symbol and stack symbol.

	  This is IPs Traffic Monitor. If some errors happen in bus,
	  this handles the error. The error type has SLVERR, DECERR
	  and TIMEOUT. This was implemented based on AXI protocol.
	  Each error is handled according to policy. There are
	  panic, scan2dram, halt and so on in policy.
