	  If you say yes here you get support for the TMU (Thermal Management
	  Unit) driver for Samsung Exynos series of SoCs. This driver initialises
	  the TMU, reports temperature and handles cooling action if defined.
	  This driver uses the Exynos core thermal APIs and TMU configuration
	  data from the supported SoCs.

	help
	  This implements the generic cpu cooling mechanism through frequency
	  reduction. An ACPI version of this already exists
	  (drivers/acpi/processor_thermal.c).
	  This will be useful for platforms using the generic thermal interface
	  and not the ACPI interface.
	  If you want this support, you should say Y here.

	  reduction.
	  If you want this support, you should say Y here.
