Description:
		For the current upstream design, userspace can request
		cooling device via "cur_state" sysfs. However, the request
		will be overwritten by other kernel governor or it will
		overwrite other governor's request. So, create this user_vote
		sysfs for userspace to request cooling device and vote with
		other kernel governor's request.
