Description:
		This directory contains the UFS I/O statistics information.
		The host driver records 6 I/O types for statistical purposes.
		- ReadCnt: number of read cmds
		- ReadBytes: total bytes from read cmds
		- WriteCnt: number of write cmds
		- WriteBytes: total bytes from write cmds
		- RWCnt: number of read/write cmds
		- RWBytes: total bytes from read/write cmds
		For different IO types, there are three logs for querying.
		-'Started': It has six 64 bit numbers, which are increased
		             when UFS requests are sent.
		-'Completed': It also has six 64 bit numbers, and the
		               numbers are increased when UFS requests are
		               completed.
		-'MaxDiff': It contains the maximum observed differences
		            between 'Started' and 'Completed' numbers.
		The I/O statistics can be reset by writing any value to the
		sysfs entry file. e.g. echo 1 > reset_io_status

		- max: the maximum time of request spending
		- avg: the average time of request spending
		- sum: the total time of request spending
