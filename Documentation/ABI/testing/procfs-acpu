Description:
		This file provides idle and frequency residency statistics for
		each CPU in the system as required by the Android Adaptive CPU
		ML model. It exposes an array of `struct acpu_stats` entries
		(see include/uapi/linux/acpu.h) in binary format. The number of
		entries in the array is equal to the number of possible (as
		opposed to online) CPUs in the system, and is ordered by
		increasing CPU ids.
